### Hi, I'm Philip! ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I want to accelerate the unravelling of biological processes using data science. Right now, I'm working on a MSc in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics @ ETH Zurich.
- ðŸŒ± Next to my coursework, I'm working on topological data analysis, as well as doing a project on cancer genomics.
- :book: I'm interested in academic and nonfictional writing, as well as optimizing my workflow using spacemacs, the framework and BYSB.
- :globe_with_meridians: Feel free to take a look at my [website](https://pjhartout.github.io).
